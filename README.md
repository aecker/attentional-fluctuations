## Typos in the published paper

We found a couple of small typos in the published version of the paper:

 * On page 1777, just before equation (9), it is printed "(i.e., 〈ψ〉 = 0)" but that zero should be a θ
 * In Eq 11, the µ's are both indexed by i but one should be indexed by j
 * In Eq 34 a tilde is missing over g_j
